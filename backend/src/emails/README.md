- **Live preview** in the center
- **Code view** to see the React component
- **HTML output** to see the final rendered HTML
- **Different preview variants** for each template

### Available Preview Variants

## üé® Customization

### Colors
All colors are from `frontend/src/styles/theme.ts` (light theme):
- Primary: `#15803d` (green)
- Background: `#faf6ed` (cream)
- Card Background: `#fffffc` (white)
- Text: `#111827` (dark gray)
- Text Secondary: `#374151` (medium gray)

### To Make Changes

1. Edit the `.tsx` files directly
2. The preview server will hot-reload automatically
3. Test in different email clients using the "Send test email" feature

### Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Match website design exactly
- **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered layout
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, readable fonts
- **Mobile-first**: Works on all devices
- **Email client compatibility**: Tested in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail

## üìù Notes

- Email templates use React Email components for better compatibility
- Inline styles are required for email clients
- Images should be hosted (not local files)
- Keep total email size under 102KB for Gmail clipping prevention
- Test in multiple email clients before production use

## üß™ Testing

To send a test email to yourself:

1. Make sure your backend server is running
2. Create a user account and subscribe to notifications
3. Use the "Send Test Email" endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/user/preferences/send-test-email
```

This will send a real email using your configured email provider (Resend).
