/**
 * Resend Email Provider Implementation
 * 
 * Concrete implementation of the EmailProvider interface using Resend as the email service.
 * This provider handles SafeCart's email delivery for user notifications and digest emails.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Simple, developer-friendly API integration
 * - React Email template support (HTML rendering)
 * - Email tagging for analytics and categorization
 * - Graceful error handling with detailed error messages
 * - Cost-effective for small to medium scale (0-50K emails/month)
 * 
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Implements EmailProvider interface for easy switching to SendGrid at scale
 * - Consistent error handling and response format across providers
 * - Environment-aware configuration (dev vs production domains)
 * - Built-in retry logic via Promise.allSettled for batch operations
 * 
 * Resend Limitations:
 * - No native batch sending API (we simulate with concurrent sends)
 * - Limited status checking API (relies on webhooks for delivery tracking)
 * - Webhook signature validation not yet implemented
 * - Rate limiting is handled at Resend's infrastructure level
 * 
 * Migration Path:
 * - When monthly volume exceeds 50K emails, switch to SendGrid
 * - All business logic remains unchanged due to interface abstraction
 * - Only configuration change needed: EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid

   * Error Handling:
   * - Network failures are caught and logged
   * - API errors (rate limits, invalid recipients) are handled gracefully
   * - Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage
   * - Always returns success=false rather than throwing exceptions

   * Implementation Strategy:
   * - Resend doesn't provide native batch API, so we simulate with concurrent sends
   * - Uses Promise.allSettled to ensure all emails attempt to send
   * - Partial failures don't prevent other emails from being sent
   * - Each email is sent independently (no transaction semantics)
   * 
   * Performance Characteristics:
   * - Concurrent sending improves throughput vs sequential
   * - Resend handles rate limiting at their infrastructure level
   * - Memory usage scales with batch size (consider chunking for large batches)
   * - Network failures affect individual emails, not entire batch
   * 
   * Business Logic:
   * - Used for daily digest sends (typically 100-1000 emails per batch)
   * - Each email contains personalized content (state-specific recalls)
   * - Failure tracking enables retry logic and user notification
   * - Results are logged for analytics and debugging
