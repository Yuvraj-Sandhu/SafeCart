Cs-137 is a man-made radioisotope of cesium. Traces of Cs-137 are widespread and can be present in the environment at background levels, and at higher levels in water or foods grown, raised, or produced in areas with environmental contamination. The primary health effect of concern following longer term, repeated low dose exposure (e.g., through consumption of contaminated food or water over time) is an elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.",

FDA is working with distributors and retailers that received product from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati after the date of first detection of Cs-137 by Customs & Border Protection (CBP), but from shipments that did not alert for Cs-137, to recommend that firms conduct a recall. In conjunction with other information, FDA determined that product from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati violates the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act in that it appears to have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with Cs-137 and may pose a safety concern.”",

In general, the small exposure to lead within the U.S. population does not pose a significant public health concern.",

While these heavy metals can affect nearly every bodily system, its effects depend upon the amount and duration of lead exposure and age. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, weakness, behavior or mood changes, delirium, seizures, and coma. However, infants, young children and the developing fetus can be affected by chronic exposure to amounts of heavy metals that may not result in obvious symptoms of lead poisoning. A child with heavy metal poisoning may not look or act sick. Heavy metal poisoning in children can cause: learning disabilities, developmental delays, and lower IQ scores.",

        "Albertsons, Randalls and Tom Thumb stores in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas are voluntarily recalling select items containing tuna salad supplied by Reser’s Fine Foods. This action follows a recall initiated by Reser’s Fine Food due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes in breadcrumbs used as an ingredient in their tuna salad.",
        "Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.",
        "Consumers who have purchased these items are urged not to consume these products and to dispose of them or return the items to their local store for a full refund. The FDA recommends in these cases that anyone who purchased or received any recalled products to use extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with these products to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. Listeria monocytogenes can survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.",
        "There have been no reports of injuries or adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.",
        "The items containing tuna salad were available for purchase at the following banner stores: Albertsons, Randalls and Tom Thumb in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.",
        "Consumers with questions should contact Albertsons Companies’ Customer Service Center at 1-877-723-3929 Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. PST.",

Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning. Symptoms of botulism include dizziness, blurred or double vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.",

If consumed, the plastic pieces could potentially cause a choking response. The issue is isolated only to the separately packaged topper and does not impact the separately packaged yogurt. This recall applies to all flavors and sizes of YoCrunch® products currently inmarket, as summarized on the table below.",
        "Consumer complaints have reported the presence of plastic pieces in the toppers, which have the potential to cause choking. The plastic pieces are transparent, may have sharp edges, and could present a risk to consumers because some pieces are between 7 and 25 mm in length. This voluntary recall was initiated on July 11, 2025, and is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company is working swiftly with retail partners to remove the impacted product from shelves, while it works to address the issue and bring back the YoCrunch® products so many people enjoy.",

People with a nut allergy or severe sensitivity to hazelnuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume these products.",
        "Out of an abundance of caution, Hartford Bakery, Inc. is removing all units of product included in the twelve effected lot codes noted below. Hartford Bakery, Inc has determined that no other lot codes were affected.",
        "The recalled “Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf” products were distributed in Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi retailers, including Kroger and Walmart. The product comes in a flexible plastic bag marked with the following information:",
        "The recall was initiated after discovering that approximately 883 loaves of bread from six production lots contained visible hazelnuts and were distributed in “Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf” packaging. While the packaging states “May Contain Tree Nuts,” it does not state that it “Contains Hazelnuts.” An investigation revealed an error in change of packaging for a hazelnut-containing bread to the implicated white bread product.",
        "While there have been no major reports of injury or illness to date, Hartford Bakery is aware of one customer who experienced digestive discomfort after consumption. Hartford Bakery also received consumer complaints from those who saw the nuts before consuming the product.",
        "Consumers who purchased the implicated products are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Hartford Bakery at 1-812-425-4642 Monday through Friday, except for holidays, from 8:00am-3:00pm CST.",
